“Can I make the SharePoint top navigation’s color and font style change dynamically via a dropdown in the built-in menu edit panel (the HorizontalNav8EditLink panel)?”

Short Answer
No, not out-of-the-box.
SharePoint’s built-in navigation menu edit panel (HorizontalNav8EditLink) does not natively allow you to control color, font, or appearance—it is only for editing links, not styles.

Details & Realistic Options
### What the Edit Panel (HorizontalNav8EditLink) Actually Supports:
You can: Add, remove, rename, or reorder links.

You cannot: Change styles, fonts, or add custom controls in this panel.

### Why?
The edit panel is controlled by SharePoint and is not extensible—Microsoft doesn’t provide hooks or APIs to inject your own custom controls (like a color picker or font dropdown) into this menu.

What Are Your Real Options?
Option 1: Custom “Settings” Panel in Your Extension (Recommended)
You CAN:

Build your own custom edit/settings panel (React modal, sidebar, or dropdown) inside your SPFx extension.

Store user choices (color, font) in:

SharePoint property bag,

A SharePoint list,

Or user profile properties.

Dynamically update your navigation’s color/font based on the stored setting.

How this works:

When users want to edit appearance, they use your custom settings panel (not the built-in menu edit).

You apply the chosen color/font in your React component and update the nav instantly.

Option 2: SharePoint “Change the Look”
You can use the built-in “Change the look” settings (Settings gear > Change the look > Theme), which lets site owners pick a site-wide color scheme and fonts—but this applies to the whole site, not just the navigation, and is not dynamic/user-specific.

Option 3: SPFx Property Pane (for Web Parts Only)
For Web Parts, you can use the property pane to provide dropdowns for colors/fonts—but Application Customizers (nav extensions) don’t have property panes in the UI.

Summary Table
Feature	Built-in Edit Panel	Custom Extension Panel	“Change the Look”
Edit nav links	✅	✅ (if you build it)	❌
Edit color/font from dropdown	❌	✅ (fully customizable)	❌ (only site-wide)
User-specific appearance	❌	✅ (if coded this way)	❌
Site-wide theme	❌	❌	✅

Conclusion
You CANNOT do it from the built-in SharePoint nav edit menu.
You CAN build this into your own SPFx extension!
If you want, I can give you a sample React code that shows a color and font picker for your nav bar, stores the selection (e.g., in local storage or a SharePoint list), and updates the style live.
